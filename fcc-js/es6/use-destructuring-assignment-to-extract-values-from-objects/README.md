# Use Destructuring Assignment to Extract Values from Objects

**Destructuring assignment is special syntax introduced in ES6, for neatly assigning values taken directly from an object.**

**Consider the following ES5 code:**

```js
const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };

const name = user.name;
const age = user.age;
```

> name would have a value of the string John Doe, and age would have the number 34.

**Here's an equivalent assignment statement using the ES6 destructuring syntax:**

```js
const { name, age } = user;
```

> Again, name would have a value of the string John Doe, and age would have the number 34.

**Here, the name and age variables will be created and assigned the values of their respective values from the user object. You can see how much cleaner this is.**

**You can extract as many or few values from the object as you want.**

**Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment. It should still assign the variables today and tomorrow the values of today and tomorrow from the HIGH_TEMPERATURES object.**

### Tests

`Passed:You should remove the ES5 assignment syntax.`

`Passed:You should use destructuring to create the today variable.`

`Passed:You should use destructuring to create the tomorrow variable.`

`Passed:today should be equal to 77 and tomorrow should be equal to 80.`
